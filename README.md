# HomeZ: Kernel Density Estimation and Minimum Convex Polygon

## Overview

This project provides implementations for Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) algorithms. These methods are used for spatial analysis and visualization of geographical data points, offering insights into density distributions and convex boundary approximations for datasets. Both algorithms are equipped with visualization features that output results as `.tiff` images.

## Features

1. **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**:
   - Visualizes the density of data points using Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation.
   - Supports configurable bandwidth for kernel smoothing.
   - Generates a density plot that is saved in `.tiff` format.

2. **Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP)**:
   - Computes the convex hull that encloses a given set of points.
   - Visualizes the convex polygon and the points, and saves the result as a `.tiff` image.

# File Selector and Data Processing Tool

## Overview

This is a desktop application built using Python and PyQt5 that allows users to select CSV files, choose a data processing algorithm (Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) or Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)), and visualize the results through image rendering. It is designed with a sleek, modern user interface that features data visualization, file selection, and result downloading functionalities.

## Features

1. **File Selection**: Allows users to select a CSV file for processing.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Offers two algorithms for data processing:
   - MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon)
   - KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)
3. **Data Visualization**: Displays the processed images for day and night data.
4. **Error Handling**: Validates inputs and provides feedback for invalid selections.
5. **Download Functionality**: Allows users to save the processed images and data to their local machine.
6. **Back Navigation**: Option to go back to the file selection window.
7. **Resizable Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes for improved user experience.
